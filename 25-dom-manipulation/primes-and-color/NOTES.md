* Semicolons:
  * optional
  * advanced: ASI (automatic semi-colon insertion)
  * basically you don't need to write them
  * but it's a good idea to write them

  * until it is
* JavaScript Versions:
  * ECMAScript the real formal name of JavaScript
  * ES6
  * big ten-year gap of no releases before ES6

  * JsNext refers to just whatever's coming out next
  * Older versions of JS did not have "classes"

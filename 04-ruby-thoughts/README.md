- Many-to-many
enumerables
- The syntax and how operators can work together within the same method. I still have trouble implementing what I've learned, i.e. if certain operators work with each other.
- When to know if a method accepts parameters and how to make sure that everything works with each other.
- Models/Model relationships
Just exactly how ruby interprets attr_accessor, writer, and reader
- Private methods, Advanced Class Methods
- Basic hashes and enumerables and differences in use of these for hashes/arrays/class variables
- I understand a lot more about classes now and how the initialize methods work. I still am a bit confused on calling other classes and their methods.
